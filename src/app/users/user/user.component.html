<p>User with ID {{ user.id }} loaded.</p>
<p>User name is {{ user.name }}</p>

<p [ngClass]="{'notes': true}">Since we are already on the User Component and since the data 
    does not change in memory rather in this case it picks the data from the URL, 
    therefor the component will not be recreated when you click Load Anna, 
    hence we need observable to listen to asynchronous changes
</p>
<a [routerLink]="['/users', '10', 'Anna']">Load Anna (10)</a>
